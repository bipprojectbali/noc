# NOC wall

A tiling wall of panes, each showing a website. Built with Bun, React, React
Router (library mode) and Zustand.

## Status

M1 and M2 of the plan are in place. The wall currently renders **one pane**;
the tree engine behind splits exists and is fully tested, but nothing renders
it yet.

| Milestone | State |
| --- | --- |
| M1 — one pane with URL bar, load state, explicit refusal state | done |
| M2 — pure tree engine: split, delete, resize, dock, invariants | done |
| M3 — tree rendering with a stable flat pane layer | not started |
| M4 — drag resize | not started |
| M5 — per-pane controls and the dock strip | not started |
| M6 — freeze and suspend policy | not started |
| M7 — persistence and saved views | not started |
| M8 — native webview renderer (Tauri) | not started |

## Requirements

- Bun 1.2.17 or newer (HTML imports must work with `bun build --compile`).
- Rust toolchain — only for the Tauri milestone, not needed yet.

## Run

```sh
bun install
bun run dev          # http://127.0.0.1:7788
```

| Script | Does |
| --- | --- |
| `bun run dev` | Dev server with hot reload |
| `bun run start` | Same server, no hot reload |
| `bun test` | Full suite |
| `bun run typecheck` | `tsc --noEmit` |
| `bun run build:binary` | Standalone executable in `dist/noc` |

## Configuration

Every environment-derived value lives in `src/config/config.env.ts`.

| Variable | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `NOC_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Loopback on purpose. See the warning below. |
| `NOC_PORT` | `7788` | Startup fails if taken; it never silently moves. |
| `NOC_DATA_DIR` | `.noc-data` | Reserved for M7 persistence. |
| `NOC_LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`. |

> **Binding to `0.0.0.0` exposes more than the UI.** The embeddability probe
> makes the server fetch URLs supplied by the client, and the saved layout names
> your internal dashboards. On a wider interface, anyone who can reach the port
> can use both.

## Two things that drive the whole design

**An iframe may never change parent in the DOM.** Splitting a pane changes its
parent, which makes React recreate the DOM node, which reloads the site. So the
layout tree and the panes are two separate layers: the tree renders empty slots,
and panes live in one flat list whose order never changes, positioned from slot
geometry. This is why `splitPane` keeps the original pane's id.

**Refusal cannot be detected from the client.** A frame blocked by
`X-Frame-Options` still fires `load` in Chromium, and its document is not
readable. So framing permission is classified server-side from the target's
response headers (`/api/embeddability`). Nothing strips or rewrites a header —
a refusal is reported to the user, not worked around.

## Layout

```
src/
  config/    environment handling
  embed/     embeddability classification (pure)
  layout/    pane tree: types, pure ops, invariants, serializer
  pane/      pane UI, URL handling, load state machine, store
  server/    entrypoint, routes, header probe
tests/       mirrors src/, plus recorded header fixtures
```

`src/server/server.entry.ts` is the only server entrypoint, shared by the dev
server and the compiled binary.
